# ICTAI-Appendix
This repository contains scripts allowing to better understand and replicate the contents of my scientific article.
This is the code I used in order to produce its figures and results.

The data folder contains filtered text data and user IDs. Only users with 6 or more tweets geolocalized in the area of London are selected, and with them their tweets.

The file bert_topic_analysis.py contains the code used to produce the heatmap and the histograms.

The file london_geo_analysis.py contains the code used to produce the Voronoi regions and get the geographical clusters.

The file requirements.txt can be used to build the same Python environment as I have, in order to easily replicate my findings.
